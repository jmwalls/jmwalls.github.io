Hi! I'm an engineer living in the San Francisco Bay Area. I enjoy pushing around
data, building models, and making predictions. Over the years, I've worked on
state estimation and localization within fleets of autonomous underwater robots,
built a variety of perception systems for self-driving cars, and, most recently,
created continent-scale maps to support AD/ADAS driving applications from
crowdsourced vehicle data.

When I'm not at work, I love spending time sucking down air on hills, watching
baseball, eating burritos, and fermenting flour and water.

Feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:jwalls9@gmail.com">jwalls9@gmail.com</a>.
